        <p>An awesomely fun super cool sandwich maker game to order sandwhiches.</p>
        <p>A game in which you try to get a high score. If you do half of coupons for you!</p>
        <p>A website for Jon and Prima Deli.</p>
        <p>A website about things we love.</p>
        <p>You create your sandwich by dragging items into the sandwich anyway you want. Then you place your order and pay.
          then it asks you if you want to play sandwich games. If you get the high score you get 10% of the next sandwich you buy!

            <li>If you get 5 high scores then you get a free sandwich</li>
            <li>If you get 10 high scores then you get a free sandwich
            and you give 3 sandwiches to the front line or the first responders</li>

            <h2>Stack the sandwich game</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of the game is to be a top sandwich maker. You'll need to be quick and accurate.
                You'll need to be a sandwich wizard of such quality that they could work at Prima Deli.

                On the top of the screen are 1 to 10 plates (the more plates the more difficult) with orders above them.
                The orders will be an ordered list of ingredients like:
                <ol>
                    <li>slice of bread</li>
                    <li>tomato</li>
                    <li>piece of lettuce</li>
                    <li>3 slices of ham</li>
                    <li>slice of bread</li>
                </ol>
                On the bottom of the screen will be a conveyor belt of moving ingredients. You can only take the ingredient in front.
                You will need to use your judgment of where to place the ingredients so you can make all the sandwiches as quickly as possible.
                If you get an order wrong your turn is over!

                For example let's say we have the following ingredients on the belt:
                <div class="conveyor-belt">
                    Tomato -> Lettuce -> Ham
                </div>
                If you had two orders order #1 calling for ham and then tomato and order #2 calling for ham and then lettuce the
                player will need to place the ham on order #2 for optimal performance.
